## Image Classification Hackathon: Identifying Icon Types in Datasets

Description:
Participated in an image classification competition where the task was to classify different types of icons in a dataset using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The challenge involved working with a variety of icon types and required the use of advanced deep learning techniques to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Technologies Used:
Python

PyTorch

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Residual Blocks

Inception Blocks

Batch Normalization

## Model Architecture:
The model architecture utilized a combination of CNN layers, residual blocks, and inception blocks, with batch normalization and dropout for regularization. The model's final layers included a fully connected (FC) layer and output layer for classifying the icons into 10 distinct categories.

## Training & Performance:

Epochs: 30

Training Accuracy: 100%

Validation Accuracy: 92.86%

Loss at Epoch 15: 0.0005

 Early Stopping: Triggered after achieving the highest validation accuracy

Note: The model showed excellent performance during training but exhibited signs of overfitting, as evidenced by the high training accuracy (100%) compared to the validation accuracy (92.86%).
